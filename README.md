# Customer-Churn-Analysis
Analyze customer churn data to identify patterns and factors contributing to customer attrition, and provide actionable insights to improve customer retention strategies.

# Key Steps:
# Data Collection:
Gather customer data from various sources such as CRM systems, transaction logs, and customer feedback.

# Data Preparation: 
Clean and preprocess the data to ensure its quality and suitability for analysis. This may include handling missing values, normalizing data, and creating relevant features.

# Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): 
Use Power BI’s visualization tools to explore the dataset, identify patterns, and gain initial insights. Create visualizations such as histograms, scatter plots, and bar charts to understand the distribution of data and relationships between variables.

# Churn Rate Calculation: 
Define churn criteria (e.g., customers who have not made a purchase in a certain period) and calculate the churn rate. Visualize churn rates over time to identify trends and patterns.

# Feature Engineering: 
Create new features that may help in predicting churn, such as customer tenure, frequency of purchases, and average spending.

# Predictive Modeling:
Use Power BI’s built-in machine learning capabilities to build predictive models that forecast potential churn. Evaluate the model’s performance using metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 score.

# Visualization and Reporting: 
Create interactive dashboards and reports to communicate your findings. Use Power BI’s drag-and-drop interface to design visually appealing and informative reports that highlight key insights and recommendations.
